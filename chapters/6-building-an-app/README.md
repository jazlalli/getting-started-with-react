# Building an app

Let's start building out a sample application. In the code folder, you'll find a ready bootstrapped project, which should look pretty much the same as what you ended up with at the end of the previous chapter.

The app we're building will be the age old TodoApp. From a high-level, we want to manage a list of todo items (add/remove), toggle their status (complete/incomplete), and display some related data (%age complete for example).
