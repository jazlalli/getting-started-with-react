# [Thinking in React](https://facebook.github.io/react/docs/thinking-in-react.html)

- React isn't an MVC framework
- React doesn't use templates

React introduces new set of ideas which are different than already established *best parctises*.
It encorages developers to move away from MVC and instead adopt a UI component based approach. Instead of thinking of your application in therms of MVC, think about it as a collection of UI components.

React takes more functional approach based user interfaces, opposing to MVC, which can be described in terms of OOP. Just like simple reusable
functions, React helps organize our applications into reusable UI components. The functional approach makes the components easy to test and simplifies the problem of managing state in large scale web applications.

React is just a view layer, nothing more. Everything in React is a component. You can think of these as web components, Ember components, or Angular directives. They simply represent a section of your UI.
