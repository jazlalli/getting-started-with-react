# React.js

> React is an open-source JavaScript library for creating user interfaces.

It encourages the creation of reusable UI components which present data that changes over time.
React has been developed at Facebook and it was open-sourced in May 2013. Since then it has been used by many companies like: Airbnb, Netflix, Instagram and [many others](https://github.com/facebook/react/wiki/Sites-Using-React).

React is mostly not opinionated about how your application is structured. It also does not impose how the data is fetched and handled, it's up to the developer. That makes it very flexible. It means that it can be used with other libraries like Backbone, Angular or any other solution. React is only conerned with rendering the UI from a data model.

It is very simple yet incredibly powerful. Its simplicity makes it easy to pick up in a short
amount of time.
