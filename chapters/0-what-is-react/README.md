# React.js

> React is an open-source JavaScript library for creating user interfaces.

It encourages the creation of reusable UI components that present data which changes over time.

React is developed by Facebook and open-sourced in May 2013. Since then it has been adopted by many companies like: Airbnb, Netflix, Instagram and [many others](https://github.com/facebook/react/wiki/Sites-Using-React).

React is mostly not opinionated about how your application is structured. It also does not impose how the data is fetched and handled, that's left up to the developer. That makes it very flexible. It means that it can be used with other libraries like Backbone, Angular or any other solution. React is only concerned with rendering your UI from a data model.

This flexibility makes it incredibly powerful, yet it retains an air of simplicity throughout (Angular's isolate scope anyone?). This makes it easier to more complex UIs with confidence and predictability.
