# Setting up your dev environment

We want all the good things...

- React (obviously)
- ES2015 (via Babel)
- Module Bundling (Webpack)
- Hot/live reloading (HMR)

*JAZ* I think if we can get them to navigate to the code folder, and then actually go through the steps of setting up, that'd be really good. Like...

- `npm install ...`
- install and setup babel for ES2015 and React
- install and configure webpack
